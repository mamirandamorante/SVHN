# SVHN
Image classifier for the SVHN dataset. In this notebook, I create a neural network that classifies real-world images digits using the SVHN dataset. This is an image dataset of over 600,000 digit images in all. SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images. The data set can be found here:

This is based on the paper from:

Y. Netzer, T. Wang, A. Coates, A. Bissacco, B. Wu and A. Y. Ng. "Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning". NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning, 2011.

The goal is to develop an end-to-end workflow for building, training, validating, evaluating and saving a neural network that classifies a real-world image into one of ten classes.
