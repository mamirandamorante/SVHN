# SVHN Image classifier for the SVHN dataset. 

The goal of this project is to develop an end-to-end workflow for building, training, validating, evaluating and saving a neural network that classifies a real-world image into one of ten classes. This is based on the paper from:

Y. Netzer, T. Wang, A. Coates, A. Bissacco, B. Wu and A. Y. Ng. "Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning". NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning, 2011

The neural network that classifies real-world images digits is based on a CNN architecture and use the SVHN dataset. This is an image dataset of over 600,000 digit images obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.
